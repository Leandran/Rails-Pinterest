A Pinterest type web app named Pinterested. 

Project completed from: https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Ruby-Rails-Web-Development/dp/0692364218.

Fixes while working through the book.

* Used Bootstrap CDN rather than continually using the Bootstrap gem
* Used Active storage rather than Paperclip gem as it is depracated
* Certain methods of Devise had to be changed due to those methods falling away with Rails 4
